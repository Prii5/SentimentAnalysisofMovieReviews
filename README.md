This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify reviews as positive or negative by analyzing text data.It combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning to preprocess and represent text in a machine-understandable format for sentiment classification.




**Tools and Libraries**

Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordClouds

NLP Processing: NLTK

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn





**Key Components**

1._Understanding Text and Sentiment Relationship:_

The model predicts sentiment by learning the relationship between review text and its label.Utilized count vectorization, transforming text into numerical representations by analyzing token frequency, enabling the model to associate specific words with sentiments.

2._Data Preprocessing for Machine Readability:_

Applied NLP techniques:
Tokenization to split text into manageable pieces.
Removal of punctuation, special characters, and stopwords (e.g., "the," "a," "and").
Conversion of text to lowercase for uniformity.
Stemming to reduce words to their root forms (e.g., "running" â†’ "run").






**Model Development**

_Text representation_ using CountVectorizer to create token-count matrices.

_Explored supervised learning algorithms:_
Naive Bayes Classifier (MultinomialNB): A robust choice for text classification.
Support Vector Machines (SVC): For high-dimensional data analysis.





**Evaluation Metrics**

Accuracy: To measure overall model performance.
